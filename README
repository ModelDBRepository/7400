Lytton WW; Lipton P. Can the hippocampus tell time?: The
temporo-septal engram shift model.
Neuroreport, 10:2301--2306, 1999.

This example produces Fig. 1 p 2302 as shown in fig1.gif.  The
simulation takes several minutes and the progress is indicated in the
console window by printing the time approximately every 300 ms.  At 5000
ms, the figure will be displayed in two graph windows.  The raster plot
will probably be hidden underneath the plot of Net[20].soma.v(0.5)
NB: the first cycle of stimulation produces an initialization artifact
(bursting in all cells) that is not shown in the original figure.

Michael Hines made some non-substantive changes to vecst.mod (derived
from vecst.mod.orig) to allow running the model under mswin and on the
mac.  The most significant being the incorporation of a free version of
srand/drand from
http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/activity/c/cgs/src/math/drand48/
 Under mswin, this model can only be run using NEURON version 5.2
2002/02/28 or later since it makes use of calls to sprintf and
hoc_obj_file_arg which were not exported by earlier versions.  On a MAC
you may need to increase the memory size for NEURON to 24MB.
